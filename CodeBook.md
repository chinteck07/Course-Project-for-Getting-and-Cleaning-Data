|  1	 | subject				| ID assigned to 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years																											  |
|  2	 | activity				| 6 activities(WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)																					  |
|  3 - 8 | tBodyAcc-"A"()-"B"	| Time in sec which taken using accelerometer to measure the body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration which "A" is referring to "mean" or " standard deviation" and B is referring to "X", "Y" or "Z" axis 	  |
|  9 -14 | tGravityAcc-mean()-"A" | Time in sec which taken using accelerometer to measure the body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration which "A" is referring to "mean" or " standard deviation" and B is referring to "X", "Y" or "Z" axis |
|  15- |tBodyAccJerk-mean()-X  | The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'  |
|   |  tBodyGyro-mean()-X  | The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. |
